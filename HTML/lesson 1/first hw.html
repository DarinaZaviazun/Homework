 <h2>Information about band</h2>
 <p><i><b>Twenty One Pilots</b> (stylized in all lowercase or as twenty øne piløts) is an American musical duo from 
     Columbus, Ohio. The band was formed in 2009 by lead vocalist Tyler Joseph along with Nick Thomas and Chris Salih, both of 
     whom left in 2011. Since their departure, the line-up has consisted of Joseph and drummer Josh Dun. The duo is best known 
     for the singles "Stressed Out", "Ride", and "Heathens". The group received a Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group 
     Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards for "Stressed Out".</i></p>
     <p><i>The band independently released two albums, Twenty One Pilots (2009) and Regional at Best (2011), before being signed
      by record label Fueled by Ramen in 2012. Their label debut, Vessel, was released in 2013. The duo achieved breakthrough
       success with their fourth album, Blurryface (2015), which produced the successful singles "Stressed Out" and "Ride" 
       and became the first album in history on which every track received at least a gold certification from the Recording 
       Industry Association of America.[1][2] The release of the single "Heathens" also made the group the first alternative 
       artist to have two concurrent top ten singles in the United States.[3] The duo's fifth studio album, Trench, was 
       released on October 5, 2018.</i></p>

     <td valign="top"><p><b>Tyler Robert Joseph</b> (born December 1, 1988) is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, 
         multi-instrumentalist, and record producer. He is best known as the frontman for the musical duo Twenty One Pilots. 
         He also released a solo album titled No Phun Intended in 2008. As a member of Twenty One Pilots he has been nominated 
         for six Grammy Awards, of which he has won one.</p>
         <p>Joseph has a three-part tattoo that represents "something that saved his life". Though it is assumed it deals with 
        his Christian faith, Joseph has been specific about the fact that he doesn't want the meaning of his tattoos spread 
        across the internet. However, he has stated a few times that he is willing to tell people one-on-one if they decide 
        to ask him in person.</p>

        <p>Both Joseph and Twenty One Pilots drummer, Josh Dun also have an "X" tattoo on their body symbolizing their dedication 
        to their hometown fans in Columbus, Ohio. They received it on stage during their hometown show at the Lifestyle Communities
         Pavilion on April 26, 2013. Joseph's is located on his right bicep and Dun's is located on his neck behind his 
         right ear.</p>
        
         <p>In mid-January 2015, Joseph served at former bandmate Chris Salih's wedding as an attendant, alongside Twenty One Pilots
         producer, Mark Eshleman, and his former roommate, Josh Sinclair.<p></p>
        
         <p>Joseph married Jenna Black on March 28, 2015, after they became engaged on July 8, 2014. On September 7, 2019, it was 
        announced that Joseph and his wife were expecting their first child, a girl. Their daughter was born on February 9, 
        2020</p></td>

     <td valign="top"><p><b>Joshua William Dun</b> (born June 18, 1988) is an American musician. He is best known as half of Twenty One Pilots, 
        alongside Tyler Joseph, contributing drums and percussion.</p>
        <p>Quitting his job at Guitar Center, Dun planned to leave for Nashville, Tennessee in pursuit of a drum career in the 
        industry; however, he was stopped by Twenty One Pilots drummer Chris Salih, who offered him his role. He went on 
        to play a show with Tyler Joseph after Salih and bassist Nick Thomas left the group due to busy schedules. They played 
        one song before police officers eventually cancelled the show. Dun subsequently became the band's full-time drummer.</p>

        <p>As a duo Twenty One Pilots released the band's second studio album, Regional at Best, on July 8, 2011, and signed with 
        record label Fueled by Ramen, a subsidiary of Atlantic Records, in April 2012.</p>

        <p>The band's fourth studio album, Blurryface, was released on May 17, 2015, two days ahead of its intended release date.
         At this point in Twenty One Pilots' career, the band had topped the charts with their hit "Stressed Out" – the song's 
         music video being filmed at Dun's childhood home, and has since received over 2 billion views on YouTube.</p>
